# TradingBot2 (first working iteration)
This is my first WORKING bit of Python code that was designed to open doors for me into developing a Trading Bot that can make live trades on some given exchange, 24/7, on my behalf.

## Getting Started
In terms of how to install, configure, and execute the project, unless I'm mistaken one can simply copy/paste the Python code I created for the project.

## Prerequisites
Prior to running the project, you will need to (use the pip feature?) to (install?) the backtrader, pandas, and Quandl (libraries?).

## Installation
Not sure what to put here and this is a straightforward project AND my first one.

## Usage
This program will produce the theoretical Final Value of a series of trades using the Apple, Inc. stock during a 5-year timeframe in the past, if it had occurred as my code has been instructed to behave.

## Contributing
Open to suggestion.

## License

## Acknowledgements 
In addition to backtrader, pandas, Quandl, I also used the NASDAQ website.  Finally, I leaned heavily on the knowledge and experience of my mentor, Matthew Sevey.  Thank you!
